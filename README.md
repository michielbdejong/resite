This is my personal server. It runs on https://michielbdejong.com/ and includes:

* a webserver
* a remoteStorage server
* a post-me-anything endpoint

You're free to fork it, but expect a hands-on user experience if you do. :)

The remoteStorage server is based partly on [gh:jcoglan/restore](https://github.com/jcoglan/restore) (MIT-license, copyright @jcoglan), and partly on [gh:remotestorage/remotestorage-server](remotestorage-server).

I'm personally using this with my SPDY/SNI-offloader [gh:michielbdejong/cell](Cell), on top of CoreOS.

Compared with the original reStore, reSite uses the [remotestorage-server](http://npmjs.org/package/remotestorage-server) npm package, and an adapted version of the FileTree storage. Really what it mainly borrows from jcoglan's original reStore server is the OAuth dialog, and the code structure. There was a [pull-request](https://github.com/jcoglan/restore/pull/13) for this fork in 2014, but since there has not been a lot of action on that, I renamed this server to reSite, to avoid confusion around the cumbersome name "my personal fork of reStore".
